1. The file "Examples.m" contains a few working examples explaining how spinner code can be used in practice. This file should be treated as a starting point.

2. "spinnerCV.m" - the implementation of the main method. This function performes the cross-validation to find the optimal tuning parameters and returns the corresponding spinner estimate. Different options are possible as shown in "Examples.m".

3. "spinner.m" - this function solves the spinner optimization problem for user-defined pair of tuning parameters.

4. "spinnerHeatmap.m" - this creates the heatmap of given matrix, such as zeros of the matrix are indicated in the heatmap by white color.
